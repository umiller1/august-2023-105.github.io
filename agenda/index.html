                <p>
                  — The color of your bread tag has a
                  meaning. The varying colors indicate
                  which day of the week the bread was
                  baked. The color system is even
                  alphabetical: Monday is blue, Tuesday is
                  green, Thursday is red, Friday is white,
                  and Saturday is yellow. Traditionally, 
                  bread wasn’t delivered on Wednesday or Sunday. This system is more for internal
                  use among employees.
