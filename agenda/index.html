                  China owns almost all pandas around the world, including
                  any that are birthed. The last panda not owned
                  by China is Xin Xin, who was one of the two pandas
                  gifted to Mexico in 1975. Hence the term "Panda Diplomacy"
                  as China gives nations they are friendly with Pandas but
                  takes them back if they are no longer on friendly terms.
