                  â€” <b>Kangaroos can pause pregnancy.</b>
                  <br>
                  Kangaroo babies are known as joeys. If a joey
                  is occupying the pouch and a Kangaroo gets pregnant,
                  the new baby will go dormant until the older sibling
                  leaves the pouch. The mother will send hormonal signals
                  to resume the younger joey's development.
