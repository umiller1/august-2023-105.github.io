                    Today, we're going to actually be coding
                    out some html. We'll be learning about
                    HTML Headings and Text Styling elements
                    along with how to code them. We'll also
                    learn the anatomy of HTML elements.

                    First, we have a powerpoint on Intro to
                    Github
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, we have a powerpoint on HTML Tags
                    and Elements
                </li>
                <li>
                    Afterwards, we'll have a demo on HTML
                    Headings
                </li>
                <li>
                    After a short break, we have another demo
                    on HTML Text Styling Elements
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, we'll have a powerpoint on Clean
                    Code - Part 1
                </li>
                <li>
                    This will be followed by the Hello World
                    exercise and the Basic HTML Drills exercise.

                  â€” The human body contains about 0.2 milligrams
                  of gold that resides mostly in our blood. Pure gold is also edible due to it being biologically inert.
