            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>
            ,<sup>[1]</sup>
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,
            <sup>[2]</sup> or 
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i>
            <sup>[3]</sup>)
            is a feature observed in some tree species, in 
            which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not 
            touch each other, instead forming a canopy with 
            channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup>
            This is most prevalent among trees of the same 
            species, but also occurs between trees of 
            different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup> 
            There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
            shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research 
            suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
            leaf-eating insect larvae.

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness 
            is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup>
            It has been discussed in scientific literature
            since the 1920s.
            <sup>[9]</sup> 
            The variety of 
            hypotheses and experimental results might 
            suggest that there are multiple mechanisms 
            across different species, an example of 
            convergent evolution.

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation 
            of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" 
            of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer 
            physical damage as they collide with each other 
            during winds. The abrasions and collisions 
            induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest 
            that lateral branch growth is largely 
            uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by 
            mechanical abrasion.
            <sup>[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artificially prevented from 
            colliding in the winds, they gradually fill 
            the canopy gaps.
            <sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown
            shyness between branches of the same organism. 
            Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is 
            particularly seen in conditions conducive to 
            this pruning, including windy forests, stands of
            flexible trees, and early succession forests 
            where branches are flexible and limited in 
            lateral movement.
            <sup>[6][12]</sup> 
            According to this theory, variable flexibility 
            in lateral branches greatly influences the 
            degree of crown shyness.
